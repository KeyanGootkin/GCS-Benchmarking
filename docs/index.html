# Making Measurements for eUCLID

So you'd like to make a GCS measurement for eUCLID, good luck! Here are the steps that you will need to take to make CME measurements and add them to this GitHub repository.

You will need to:

1) Add/Edit Your Home Directory

    * Copy ne2mass.pro and idl_startup.pro to your home directory

    * Edit your .cshrc file

    * Change your permissions in your home directory

2) Make Directories

    * Create a folder called gcs_outputs in your home directory

    * Inside gcs_outputs make a unique data directory

3) Make Measurements

    * Open the GCS CME measurement software and prepend a 0 to the file name

4) Submit Measurements

    * After you make your measurements copy the .rt file from gcs_outputs into your data directory

    * Make and use aliases to be able to copy files from uhurub to your local machine

    * Push those measurements to GitHub
